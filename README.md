<a>https://github.com/dosterz97/FBLA-App</a>

Digital Yard Sale is an IOS app that simulates a virtual store.
It allows you to login/register, 'purchase' items and interact with them.

The app does not actually collect payment information, nor does it interact with an online API.
The app runs on a local data base called Realm, which holds all the data the persists beyond memory.
DYS was built using XCode and Swift 3.0.2.
